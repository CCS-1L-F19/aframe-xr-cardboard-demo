# Aframe XR Cardboard Demo
This is an Aframe-based 6DoF VR application using mobile AR for world tracking functionality. It is a work in progress. 
Check out the demo here: https://ccs-1l-f19.github.io/aframe-xr-cardboard-demo/boundary/index.html

# Installation
While Aframe is implemented in JS and does not require installation, this project uses experimental APIs for AR tracking. Here are the one-time installation steps:

## iOS
1. Go to the App store and download (WebXR Viewer)[https://apps.apple.com/us/app/webxr-viewer/id1295998056] by Mozilla.
2. Send the `aframe-xr-cardboard` certificate from the `autogen` folder to the phone. This can be done through Mail, AirDrop, and many other services. 
3. The phone should prompt to add the certificate to Settings. Click Verify to do so. If the prompt does give such an option, try sending to the phone via different means.
